    "text": "What is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\n\n\nKey characteristics\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

    "text": "I’m currently in my second year of the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University, where I also work part-time as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Data Analyst. My educational journey began at Mumbai University in India, where I pursued a bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. After completing my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable work experience as an Associate System Analyst over the course of two years in the Fintech Industry. With the formal title of Associate System Analyst, I had a variety of hats to wear throughout my tenure at NSEIT. I developed user interfaces for apps that improved their usability and helped create analytics dashboards. I played a significant role on the team that created front-end and back-end services and managed databases. Working at a software firm requires a lot of collaboration with other team members using technologies like GIT and SVN, which I personally found to be particularly useful.\nI’m a strong believer in data science’s ability to extract valuable insights from large datasets and address real-world challenges that might otherwise remain useless. I am particularly interested in Data Analytics and Data Visualization as I believe I had a necessary head start from my two years of IT work experience and my master’s program only catapult me deeper into the incredible field of Data Science!\nWhen I’m not immersed in academics or data analysis, you can find me exploring my creative side through painting, enjoying leisurely walks, or experimenting with new quick recipes in my cozy kitchen.\n\nReflecting On My Journey Through This Project\nThis project has truly been a game-changer in preparing me to tackle real-world data challenges across various industries. From mastering the traditional modeling techniques like ARIMA and SARIMA to diving into advanced techniques such as ARIMAX, SARIMAX, VAR, and even delving into deep learning with LSTM and GRU models, I’ve felt empowered to handle complex data scenarios with confidence.\nBeyond just technical skills, this learning journey has deepened my understanding of the importance of data visualization, model interpretation, critical thinking in the analysis process and effectively communicating findings to stakeholders. As I look ahead, I’m certain that the lessons learned here will continue to guide me in making meaningful contributions to real-world temporal data challenges.\nLastly, I am deeply grateful to Dr. Purna for her invaluable expertise and mentorship which has been instrumental in shaping my learning journey and preparing me for the success of this project and course.\n\n\nEducation\nGeorgetown University, Washington DC | M.S.
